# Acrobot Environment Solved using DQN
### Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
A Deep Q-Network is a neural network which acts as a value function approximator for environments which have very large state space and action space, thereby allowing us to easily predict the action-value function or state-value function for any state. Combined with the Q-learning Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, it can be used to solve complex environments.
